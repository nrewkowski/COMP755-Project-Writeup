\section{Results}
DSCDSSF
% summarize current quantitative/qualitative results
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!HOW MANY IMAGES NICK GENERATES AT 480P. 
HOW LONG IT TAKES. 
APPARATUS USED
\section{Analysis \& Discussion}
SCDSSDCDS
% discussion of meaning of results
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!DON'T USE IMAGENET
!!!!!!!!!480P NOT ENOUGH TO CROP WELL
!!!!!!!!!!NEED FOR MORE STORAGE
COULDN'T COMPARE AND ANALYZE EFFECT OF PARTICLES, POST-PROCESS, ETC. BUT THE DATA IS GENERATED AND MADE PUBLIC
\subsection{Limitations}
IMAGENET MISSING MANY USEFUL OBJECTS OF INTEREST. IN HINDSIGHT WOULDN'T HAVE USED IT
too many images are generated for bigger objects since it exports every frame, so more weight is applied to the bigger objects is they are predicted incorrectly (which is very likely as we are mostly recognizing smaller objects)
